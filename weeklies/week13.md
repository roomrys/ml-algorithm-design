# 📘 Week 13 – Capstone Implementation: Part I

## 🎯 Goals
- Begin implementing the core of your capstone
- Set up reproducible experiments
- Track all baselines and intermediate results

---

## ✅ Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Code base model or algorithm
- [ ] Write reusable functions/classes (models, training loops, logging)
- [ ] Set up evaluation metrics + logging (wandb, CSV, plots)

---

## 🧪 Experiment Goals
- [ ] Run and validate first working baseline
- [ ] Document unexpected behaviors or bugs

---

## 🌍 Public Deliverables
- [ ] `/projects/capstone_project/code/`
- [ ] Intermediate results notebook or logs
- [ ] Update README with new progress

---

## 📚 Resources
- 📘 *Reproducibility Tips*: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/
- 📼 PyTorch Lightning, MLflow, or wandb tutorials (for experiment tracking)
